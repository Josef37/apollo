A Studio organization can have any number of members, and each member can be assigned a **role** that defines their capabilities within the organization.

## Member roles in organizations

> **Member roles are available for Enterprise accounts.**
>
> Apollo Support can also grant access to the Billing Manager role for Team accounts on request. Please contact support@apollographql.com for more information.
>
> If you're using member roles, [please let us know what you think!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10C4_ETX5Xb60RfnJjBC2xBVK9gjr6A644AYKA-27T-E/viewform) Your feedback will help us improve the feature before we roll it out to all organizations.
>
> If roles are **not** enabled for your organization, all members can perform all actions described in [Role permissions](#role-permissions).

Each organization member has one of the following roles:

| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Organization Admin` | Has management access to the entire organization, including its members, graphs, and configuration.                                                                                                                |
| `Graph Admin`        | Has management access to the organization's graphs, but not to members or organization-level configuration. Intended for developers who are considered admins to the graph.                                        |
| `Contributor`        | Can push new schemas to graphs, but cannot configure graph settings or integrations. Intended for back-end developers who are authorized to make changes to graphs.                                                |
| `Observer`           | Has view-only access to the organization's graph data, such as schemas and metrics. Can also execute queries in the Explorer. Intended for back-end developers who are _not_ authorized to make changes to graphs. |
| `Consumer`           | Has view-only access to the organization's graph _schemas_, but not metrics. Can also execute queries in the Explorer. Intended for application developers building clients against a graph.                       |
| `Billing Manager`    | Has management access to organization-level configuration and billing. Can also remove members (but not invite them). No access to graphs.                                                                         |

> On XX/YY/ZZ, we introduced the **Graph Admin** role and redefined the **Contributor** role to have fewer permissions. All members who were **Contributors** before that point were automatically reduced to updated Contributor role *with a lower permission set* unless otherwise discussed with your customer success manager.

Only organization admins can assign roles to other members. You can see which role you have in a particular organization from your [user settings page](https://studio.apollographql.com/user-settings), or from that organization's Members tab.

## Member roles for graphs

For any graph in your organization, you can provide a single member with a **graph role override** that will replace the permissions allotted by their organization role.

Graph admins and organization admins may set graph role overrides. Graph role overrides must strictly be *promotions* from the member's organization role; you cannot enforce a *permission downgrade* with a graph role override.

You cannot set graph role overrides for organization admins. They will always be full admins unless you downgrade their role on the organization.

## Inviting members

**Organization admins** can invite individual members by email address from your organization's Members tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com). Organization admins can also create a persistent **invite link** from the organization's Settings tab, which can be used to invite any number of members. Using either method, an org admin can specify which role a new member receives.

> **Do not share invite links publicly.** Anyone with the link can join your organization. If an invite link becomes compromised, an admin can replace or disable it from the Settings tab.

## Removing members

Both **organization admins** and **billing managers** can remove members from your organization's Members tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com).
