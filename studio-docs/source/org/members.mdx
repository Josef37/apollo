A Studio organization can have any number of members, and each member can be assigned a **role** that defines their capabilities within the organization.

## Organization-wide member roles

> **Member roles are available for organizations with an Enterprise plan.**
>
> Apollo Support can also grant access to the Billing Manager role for Team accounts on request. Please contact **support@apollographql.com** for more information.
>
> If you're using member roles, [please let us know what you think!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10C4_ETX5Xb60RfnJjBC2xBVK9gjr6A644AYKA-27T-E/viewform) Your feedback will help us improve the feature before we roll it out to all organizations.
>
> If roles are **not** enabled for your organization, all members can perform all actions described in [Role permissions](#role-permissions).

Each organization member has one of the following roles:

| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Organization Admin` | Has management access to the entire organization, including its members, graphs, and configuration.                                                                                                                |
| `Graph Admin`        | Has management access to the organization's graphs, but not to members or organization-level configuration. Intended for developers who are considered admins to the graph.                                        |
| `Contributor`        | Can push new schemas to graphs, but cannot configure graph settings or integrations. Intended for back-end developers who are authorized to make changes to graphs. _Cannot_ push schema changes to [protected variants](./graphs/#protected-variants-enterprise-only).                                               |
| `Observer`           | Has view-only access to the organization's graph data, such as schemas and metrics. Can also execute queries in the Explorer. Intended for back-end developers who are _not_ authorized to make changes to graphs. |
| `Consumer`           | Has view-only access to the organization's graph _schemas_, but not metrics. Can also execute queries in the Explorer. Intended for application developers building clients against a graph.                       |
| `Billing Manager`    | Has management access to organization-level configuration and billing. Can also remove members (but not invite them). No access to graphs.                                                                         |

Only members with the `Organization Admin` role can assign roles to other members. You can see which role you have in a particular organization from your [user settings page](https://studio.apollographql.com/user-settings), or from the organization's Members tab.

## Graph-specific member roles

You can override a member's organization-wide role for individual graphs. For example, if a member has the `Observer` role in your organization, you can assign them the `Contributor` role for a graph that they need extra access to.

> A member's graph-specific role must have _more_ permissions than their organization-wide role.

Members with the `Graph Admin` or `Organization Admin` role can assign graph-specific roles from the Access tab of the graph's Settings page.

When `Contributors` in an organization create a new graph, they are automatically granted the `Graph Admin` role on that graph.

## Role permissions

> In January 2021, we added the `Graph Admin` role and reduced permissions for members with the `Contributor` role.

### Billing Managers
`Billing Managers` cannot see or manage graphs in their organizations, but they can:
- Remove members from the organization
- View and edit billing information
- Manage organization configuration (name, avatar, etc.)

Notable, `Billing Managers` cannot invite new members to their organizations.

### Dev Graphs

It is worth noting that [Development Graphs](/dev-graphs/) take a special permission in our system.
Any user, regarldess their permission, can create a dev graph and act as the `Graph Admin` for it. Dev graphs are private to the users who creat them.

## Inviting members

**Organization admins** can invite individual members by email address from your organization's Members tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com). Organization admins can also create a persistent **invite link** from the organization's Settings tab, which can be used to invite any number of members. Using either method, an org admin can specify which role a new member receives.

> **Do not share invite links publicly.** Anyone with the link can join your organization. If an invite link becomes compromised, an admin can replace or disable it from the Settings tab.

## Removing members

Both **organization admins** and **billing managers** can remove members from your organization's Members tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com).
